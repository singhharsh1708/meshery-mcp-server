# mesherytest

A fake Meshery Server for testing Meshery clients, including MCP servers.

It is a real `httptest.Server` that reproduces Meshery's actual behaviour on the
endpoints an MCP server reads, quirks included, and then lets a test assert on
what the client sent rather than only on what came back.

```go
func TestMyTool(t *testing.T) {
	fake := mesherytest.New(t)
	client := myclient.New(fake.URL(), fake.Token, fake.Provider)

	out, err := client.ListResources(ctx, fake.Data().ClusterID())
	// ... assert on out ...

	fake.AssertAuthenticated(t)
	fake.AssertClusterScoped(t, "/api/system/meshsync/resources", fake.Data().ClusterID())
	fake.AssertZeroBasedPaging(t, "/api/pattern")
}
```

## Why

Meshery has several endpoints that answer a wrong request with `200 OK` and
nothing in it. `GET /api/system/meshsync/resources` filters with
`cluster_id IN (?)`, so a missing filter binds an empty slice and the cluster
reads as empty. Pagination is zero-based on both of Meshery's offset paths, so a
client that opens at page 1 skips the first page of every list. Most handlers
read only the lowercase `pagesize` and ignore `pageSize` without saying so. None
of these produce an error, and an AI client presents every one of them as an
answer.

A hand-written mock cannot catch any of them, because it returns the shape the
code under test expects. The mock agrees with the code, including where the code
is wrong about Meshery. The test passes, the reviewer sees green, and the failure
shows up the first time someone points the thing at a real server.

## What it reproduces

Every behaviour below is taken from a handler in `meshery/meshery` at current
master, cited in `doc.go` next to the code that reproduces it.

**Authentication.** The two credentials are not symmetric.
`RemoteProvider.GetToken` reads `req.Cookie("token")` and nothing else, so an
`Authorization` header is not a session and neither is a token on the query
string. The provider selection has three channels: the `meshery-provider`
cookie, else an HTTP header of the same name, else `?provider=`. The fake
accepts all three for the provider and only the cookie for the token, and
`AssertAuthenticated` reports which channel carried it.

The first unauthenticated call is not answered with a 401 either: it is a 302 to
a login page, and a client that follows redirects gets `200 OK` with HTML and
fails inside its JSON decoder.
`WithLocalProvider()` switches to the local provider's behaviour, which accepts
everything, because that is why a client with broken auth can pass its whole
suite against a locally started Meshery and fail against a remote one.

Two 401 paths exist and are deliberately not reproduced, both documented in
`doc.go`: Meshery counts attempts in a cookie and answers 401 once retries reach
`MaxAuthRetries` (3), and it answers 401 outright when an enforced provider key
does not match. Neither is what a client meets first, and reproducing the retry
counter would make the fake stateful for no gain.

**Cluster scoping.** `/resources` takes a JSON-encoded `clusterIds` array. Omit
it and the handler binds an empty slice into `cluster_id IN (?)`, which matches
no rows, so you get `200 OK` with nothing. Send a bare unquoted id instead and
`json.Unmarshal` fails, which is a 400. The silent case and the loud
case are different, and the fake keeps them different. Its sibling
`/resources/summary` takes a repeated singular `clusterId` and answers 400
without it, so the two spellings are not interchangeable either.

**Pagination.** Zero-based on both of Meshery's offset computations
(`offset = page * limit` and `offset := (page) * pageSize`). Negative pages are
clamped to 0, the default page size is 25, and `pageSize=all` skips the limit
entirely rather than falling back to the default.

**The page-size parameter is spelled differently per endpoint, silently.** Only
`getPaginationParams` and `GetConnections` read the camelCase `pageSize` and fall
back to `pagesize`. Most handlers, including the ones behind contexts, designs,
environments, workspaces and organizations, read `q.Get("pagesize")` and nothing
else, so a client sending `pageSize` there has it ignored and gets the default of
25 with no error. The fake reproduces the spelling each endpoint actually reads
rather than accepting both everywhere, because accepting both is precisely how a
mock hides this. `AssertPageSizeSpelling` names the spelling that endpoint reads.

**Designs.** `patternFile` is a JSON *string* under a camelCase key. Decoding it
as a nested object, or reading only the older `pattern_file`, yields an empty
design and no error.

**Topology.** `?asDesign=true` empties the flat `resources` list and returns a
component graph instead, so the two are never both populated. Evaluation runs at
depth 1 and falls back to the un-evaluated design on failure while still
answering 200, which means an empty `relationships` array does not distinguish
"no edges" from "evaluation failed".

**Org scoping.** `/api/environments` answers 400 without an `orgId`, and
`/api/workspaces` answers 400 only when both `orgId` and the legacy `orgID` are
absent.

**Registry auth is a mix, not a blanket.** Every `GET` under `/api/registry` is
registered with `models.NoAuth` and needs no session, which is why a read-only
client should not be made to authenticate there. Several mutating routes are
registered with `models.ProviderAuth` and do need one, among them
`POST /api/registry/register`, `DELETE /api/registry/models/{id}`,
`POST /api/registry/relationships/evaluate` and the connection-definition
writes. `AssertAuthenticated` exempts the reads and not the writes, because
exempting the whole prefix would let an unauthenticated write through.

## Assertions

| Call | Catches |
|---|---|
| `AssertAuthenticated` | header auth, a token off the cookie, no provider on any channel |
| `AssertClusterScoped` | absent filter, bare id where an array is required, wrong spelling per endpoint |
| `AssertZeroBasedPaging` | a client that opens at page 1 |
| `AssertPageSizeSpelling` | `pageSize` sent where only `pagesize` is read |
| `AssertQuery` / `AssertNoQuery` | a dropped filter; a field that should never be requested |
| `AssertCalled` / `AssertNotCalled` | an endpoint skipped; a mutating route touched by a read-only server |

Assertions take a `mesherytest.T` interface rather than `*testing.T`, which is
how the package's own tests check that each one fires on a client that is wrong.
`*testing.T` satisfies it.

## Status

Stdlib-only, so it lifts into another repository as-is. Apache 2.0, matching
Meshery.
